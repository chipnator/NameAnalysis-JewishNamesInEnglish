# NameAnalysis-JewishNamesInEnglish
Common bases within Jewish names are found via analysis of html of a webpage with common Jewish names. 
Those bases are then compared to a list of English words, Names, and common phrases to see the relative commonality between 'typical' English names/words and names that are distinctly Jewish. 
I created this program to satisfy my curiosity about how common words/names with Jewish bases are within the English language. 
The goal and purpose of this program has subsequently become to demonstrate my capabilities as a python programmer.
